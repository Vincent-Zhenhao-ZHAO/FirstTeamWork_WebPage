Homepage:
-Love the color choice
-the contents are aligned neatly in the webpage
-good
Introduction:
- Having a description of the video would be helpful
- The color choices are adorable! Love the combinations.
- Words are clear and can be easily seen
- The idea of having background music is also cool. I think having this autoplay would    be better than having the video. 
- At the bottom part of the page. I think “I am AI and just AI” can be oriented better in  the webpage without leaving a huge space on the left
Benefits:
-The background image is not oriented or scaled properly to fit the the size of the webpage
-Using a list is a good choice to simplify content
-Appreciate that the video do not autoplay
-The words are not easy to read
Drawbacks:




Lukas
Homepage:
Cool to implement video and music
Too many colors
Used different fonts
Font feel weird with respect to AI
Video is just somewhere on the page
Introduction
Looks nice
Links on the left side could be more to the left
Layout and colors are visually pleasing
Font is nice 
Benefits
background image should be stretched I think
Hard to read the text on the image
Headline is just somewhere
Cool Video implementation
Drawbacks
Pleasing to the eye
Text a bit wide. It even cuts off on the right side if not in fullscreen
Conclusion
Same font and colors for every page could be useful
Cool media implementation
On some pages the layout was a bit weird and not centered / the links are floating at some weird position in the page


Kevin
 Homepage :  Play video automatically
                       The presence of music and video at the same page is a bit redundant
                       Layout is functional but a bit messy 
                       



Dan
Benefits / Drawbacks:

Good elements included (videos, music etc)
Engaging Information
Links all work well and go to the expected destination
Colour scheme for most pages is clean and easy to read the text



No consistent design
Some pages are a bit messy and hard to navigate

Suggestions:
Don’t use images for backgrounds
Use the same fonts and colours
